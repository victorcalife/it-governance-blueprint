# 📊 SLA Strategy & Guide

This guide outlines best practices and considerations for implementing and maintaining Service Level Agreements (SLAs) within IT organizations.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of SLAs

Service Level Agreements define clear expectations between IT and its stakeholders — ensuring alignment on delivery timeframes, responsibilities, and quality standards.

---

## 🤝 Stakeholder Alignment

Before defining SLA values, engage key stakeholders to:

- Clarify business impact and expectations  
- Define acceptable timeframes for response and resolution  
- Review application/service criticality  
- Align support structure (L1, L2, L3) with service tiers  

**Tip:** SLA definition should be a two-way conversation — not just a technical decision.

---

## 🔀 SLA Customization

SLAs should reflect the reality of different services. A critical application (e.g., ERP or WMS) may require aggressive targets, while others (e.g., reporting tools) may allow more flexibility.

**You can set SLAs by:**

- Application (ERP, CRM, custom platforms)  
- Type of request (incident, request, change)  
- User group or business unit  
- Service tier (gold, silver, bronze)
